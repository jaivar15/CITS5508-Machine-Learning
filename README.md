# CITS5508-Machine-Learning

### Context 

Extract meaningful knowledge from large amounts of data. Machine learning provides core underlying theory and techniques to data analytics, where algorithms iteratively learn from data to uncover hidden insights. 

The topics covered in this Machine Learning Unit are:
- upervised classification, 
- unsupervised classification, 
- regression, 
- support vector machines, 
- decision trees, 
- random forests, 
- dimensionality reduction, 
- artificial neural networks, 
- deep neural networks, 
- Convolution Neural Network 

### Outcomes 
1. explain the role of machine learning in knowledge extraction; 
2. explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms; 
3. demonstrate a systematic knowledge of algorithmic machine learning approaches; 
4. produce practical implementations of machine learning solution for a real-world dataset; 
5. analyse data datasets from the perspective of machine learning;
6. evaluate what deep learning is, what makes it work or fail, and critique where it should be applied.
